title: " Crypto.com probe by the SEC has officially closed, says CEO "
date: "2025-03-28"
description: "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has officially closed its investigation into Crypto.com, with no action taken against the crypto exchange, according to the firm’s CEO, Kris Marszalek.
”They used every tool available to attempt to stifle us, restricting access to banking, auditors, investors, and beyond. It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post.
”The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it. Onwards!”
It comes seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the crypto platform in August, signaling its intention to take legal action against the firm.
We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com,” added Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren in a March 27 statement, which accused the previous administration of abusing its authority to harm the crypto industry.

Crypto.com had filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October, two months after the Wells notice, accusing the Gary Gensler-led commission of overstepping its authority and taking a “misguided” approach to crypto regulation.
SEC continues to roll back previous enforcement actions
Crypto.com’s announcement follows a wave of other crypto investigations and lawsuits dropped by the SEC over the last five weeks, which affected the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea and more recently, Immutable.
The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27.

The SEC has adopted a far friendlier approach since Mark Uyeda started leading the commission as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. The SEC established a Crypto Task Force led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce to support this new approach. 
It also canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets on Jan. 23.
Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins, is inching closer to becoming the SEC’s new leader after initially being held back by financial disclosures.
Meanwhile, Crypto.com partnered with Trump Media on March 24 to launch a series of “Made in America”-themed exchange-traded funds later this year.
Crypto.com will provide the infrastructure and custody services to supply the crypto tokens for the ETFs, which may include a basket of tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cronos (CRO).

  <h2>Market Implications and Future Outlook</h2>
  <p>The recent development marks a significant victory for Crypto.com and could potentially influence the future regulatory landscape for other crypto exchanges. The SEC's decision to close its investigation also follows recent dismissals of cases against other major industry players, signaling a potential shift in the US regulatory stance towards cryptocurrency entities.</p>

  <p>In a climate of increased regulatory scrutiny around the world, the US SEC's decision could set a precedent that might affect how other international regulatory bodies approach cryptocurrency exchange investigations. With the SEC's recent activities involving Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, the ruling in favor of Crypto.com may indicate a possible softening stance on crypto regulations.</p>

  <p>The close of the investigation does not signal the end of the complex relationship between Crypto.com and the SEC, but it does mark a significant milestone in the exchange's legal battle with the US regulatory body. As the firm continues to expand its services and partnerships, the recent development will undoubtedly bolster its credibility to its user base and partners.</p>

  <p>The future implications of this development for the market will be closely watched by investors, market participants, and other cryptocurrency firms. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, so too will the regulatory environment, making for an interesting dynamic in the industry.</p>
