description: "France’s state-owned bank says it will spend 25 million euros ($27 million) buying cryptocurrencies that support local crypto and blockchain projects.
Bpifrance said in a March 27 press release that it would back newly formed projects “with a strong French footprint” where it will receive tokens in return for its investment and will look to fund decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, tokenization and artificial intelligence.
It added that the plan, supported by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, was to “promote emerging technologies and strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.”
The global blockchain ecosystem is “currently booming” but the number of French funds taking part is still very limited, it said. 
French digital and AI minister Clara Chappaz said public and private financing was “one of the keys to the sustainable positioning of our ecosystem on the international stage.”
Bpifrance deputy CEO Arnaud Caudoux said that it was convinced of the growing importance that blockchain companies “will take on in the years to come and want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets field.”
“The US is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” Caudoux said at a press conference, as reported by Reuters. He added that Bpifrance had started to support crypto before the US started its own pro-crypto moves.

The bank said it had backed the blockchain sector for a decade and had invested over 150 million euros ($162 million), notably helping to finance the crypto hardware wallet company Ledger in 2014.
Bpifrance said it began testing limited investments through tokens in 2022, including a deal with the DeFi lending platform Morpho to buy its token — which has grown to be the 12th largest protocol by value at $3.24 billion, according to DefiLlama.

Venture capitalists often take part in investments paid in tokens. PitchBook expects crypto VC deals to top $18 billion this year, a marked increase from the $13.6 billion raised in 2024.
Typically, a crypto platform that launches a token will allocate a portion of its supply to financiers subject to varying lockup periods where the tokens can’t be sold.
A portion of the token supply is usually immediately given to select public users in order to drum up liquidity, which can cause token values to slide if they cash out.

<h2>France's State Bank Invests $27M in Locally-focused Crypto</h2>

<p>A major financial move in the crypto space – France’s state-owned bank, Bpifrance, has divulged plans to invest 25 million euros ($27 million) into cryptocurrencies. This substantial injection of capital is specifically earmarked for local crypto and blockchain projects.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://presse.bpifrance.fr/bpifrance-annonce-lacceleration-de-sa-strategie-dinvestissement-en-actifs-numeriques" target="_blank">press release</a> from Bpifrance on March 27, the bank intends to support innovative ventures "with a strong French footprint". In exchange for its investment, Bpifrance will receive tokens and aims to finance areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, tokenization, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3>Upholding France's Position in the Blockchain Ecosystem</h3>

<p>The move resonates with the French Ministry of Economy and Finance's goal to propagate emerging technologies and fortify the French blockchain environment. Despite the current global surge in blockchain development, French funds remain sparse.</p>

<p>Clara Chappaz, the French digital and AI minister, expresses that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-venture-capitalist-one-billion-two-new-crypto-funds" target="_blank">both public and private financing</a> are instrumental in sustaining France's international positioning in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<section>
<h2>Fostering French Competitiveness in The Digital Assets Field</h2>

<p>Arnaud Caudoux, deputy CEO at Bpifrance, conveyed the bank's conviction that blockchain companies will hold increasing importance in the forthcoming years. Therefore, intensifying French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets space is paramount. This maneuver becomes all the more significant as the United States accelerates its own crypto strategy.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Bpifrance has also begun backing crypto projects even before the US initiated its pro-crypto movement.</p>

<h2>Evidence of Prior Crypto Support</h2>

<p>Bpifrance has already been a longstanding supporter of the blockchain sector, with investments exceeding 150 million euros ($162 million). A notable beneficiary of this support includes Ledger, a crypto hardware wallet company that the bank helped finance back in 2014.</p>

<p>The bank’s embrace of token investments started as early as 2022. It embarked on a deal with Morpho, a DeFi lending platform, to purchase its tokens. Morpho has since grown into the 12th largest protocol by value at $3.24 billion, <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/morpho" target="_blank">according to DefiLlama</a>.</p>

<h2>Predicted Growth in Crypto VC Deals</h2>

<p>Many venture capitalists participate in investments paid in tokens. According to PitchBook, crypto VC deals are predicted to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-vc-deals-february-defi-the-tie" target="_blank">exceed $18 billion this year</a>. This uptick marks a considerable jump from the $13.6 billion raised in 2024.</p>

<p>Normally, a crypto platform launching a token will distribute a certain portion of its supply to financiers. This supply, however, is subject to varying lockup periods during which the tokens cannot be sold. Select public users are also given a portion of the token supply to spur liquidity, which may depreciate token values if they decide to cash out.</p>
