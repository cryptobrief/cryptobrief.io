title: " ‘Our GPUs are melting’ — OpenAI puts limiter in after Ghibli-tsunami "
date: "2025-03-28"
description: "ChatGPT creators OpenAI have introduced rate limits after a viral social media trend that saw nearly everything “Ghiblifyied” — turned into AI art in the style of the famous Japanese animation studio. 
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of the first to take part in the trend, posting a portrait of himself generated by the model on March 25 but said in a subsequent post two days later that all image requests have started to tax the firm’s infrastructure.
“It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient,” he said.

“Also, we are refusing some generations that should be allowed; we are fixing these as fast we can,” he added.
OpenAI launched the upgraded image generation offering in ChatGPT-4o on March 25, resulting in users splashing images across social media in the art style of Studio Ghibli — known for its anime films Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.
Altman didn’t give a definitive timeline on how long the rate limits would last but said, “Hopefully, it won’t be long! ChatGPT free tier will get three generations per day soon.”
Rate limits are generally applied to help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure, according to OpenAI.

“If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users,” OpenAI says on its rate limit explanation page.
Along with the legions of others getting in on the trend, X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared an image mimicking King Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King holding up a Shiba Inu. 
White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks also joined in, using the Studio Ghibli-art style on an image of himself at an event.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on March 26 that OpenAI expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Altman said on Feb. 12 his firm wants to ship GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months.

    <h2>OpenAI Introduces Rate Limits Following Ghibli-inspired Art Trend</h2>
    <p>OpenAI, the team behind ChatGPT, has found it necessary to implement rate limits following a viral trend of AI generated artwork in the style of the renowned Japanese animation Studio Ghibli. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman participated in the trend by <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1904599358756315341">posting</a> a self-portrait on March 25. However, the trend quickly became so popular that it began to strain the company's resources.</p>
    <p>In response, Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1905296867145154688?s=46&amp;amp;t=MuRujqZUAz3TQE1vmr3c6A">stated</a> that due to the excess in image requests, they have started to put a strain on the firm's infrastructure. "It's super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient," he said.</p>

    <h2>Response to the Trend</h2>
    <p>Altman also mentioned that requests that should have been granted were being denied, a problem which they were addressing as quickly as possible. The updated image generation platform, ChatGPT-4o, was <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">launched</a> on March 25, leading to a deluge of Ghibli-inspired art on social media. This reveals how influential Studio Ghibli has been, with productions such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro marking their distinct style.</p>
        <p>OpenAI's CEO has yet to provide a specific timeline for the duration of these rate limits, but reassured users that "hopefully, it won't be long! ChatGPT free tier will get three generations per day soon." Rate limits are usually put in place to allow OpenAI to manage the aggregate workload on its infrastructure. If API requests drastically increase, this could lead to server congestion and performance issues. By implementing rate limits, OpenAI ensure a more consistent and smooth user experience.</p>

    <h2>Impact and Future Implications</h2>
    <p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk and White House AI advisor David Sacks also joined the trend, each sharing images generated in the signature Ghibli style. This goes to show the potential influence and reach of AI technology, not just as a tool for developers and researchers, but also as a medium for art and self-expression. As AI continues to develop, we are likely to see it permeate more and more into popular culture.</p>
    <p>In terms of OpenAI's future prospects, there are signs of significant growth. An individual familiar with the topic reported to Bloomberg that OpenAI expects to more than triple its 2025 revenue to over $12.7 billion. Furthermore, Altman suggested that they plan to deploy GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the upcoming weeks or months, indicating the continual progress and expansion of the platform.</p>
