      <p>Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) have become increasingly popular as a way to buy and sell cryptocurrency, but they come with both benefits and risks that users need to understand.</p>

      <h2>What are Bitcoin ATMs?</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks that allow users to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash or debit cards. Unlike traditional ATMs, these machines don't dispense cash but instead facilitate the purchase of digital assets.</p>

        <li>Convenience and accessibility</li>
        <li>Quick transactions</li>
        <li>No bank account required</li>
        <li>Privacy for small transactions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>
      <p>While Bitcoin ATMs offer convenience, they come with several risks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher fees compared to online exchanges</li>
        <li>Potential for scams and fraud</li>
        <li>Limited consumer protection</li>
        <li>Transaction limits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety Tips</h2>
      <p>To protect yourself when using Bitcoin ATMs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verify the ATM operator's legitimacy</li>
        <li>Double-check wallet addresses</li>
        <li>Keep transaction receipts</li>
        <li>Be aware of local regulations</li>
      </ul>

      <article>
        <p>In a bold move that mirrors MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy, gaming retail giant GameStop has announced plans to raise $1.3 billion through convertible notes to invest in Bitcoin. This decision marks another significant step in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency by major corporations.</p>

        <h2>Investment Policy Update</h2>
        <p>GameStop's board of directors has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy, enabling the company to allocate capital into Bitcoin. The gaming retailer plans to use the net proceeds from their offering for "general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin" in alignment with their new investment strategy.</p>

        <h2>Funding Structure</h2>
        <p>The company's approach involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Issuing $1.3 billion in 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030</li>
          <li>Offering initial purchasers an additional $200 million option within 13 days</li>
          <li>Notes will be unsecured obligations with no regular interest</li>
          <li>Maturity date set for April 1, 2030</li>
          <li>Flexible conversion options including cash, Class A common stock, or both</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Market Impact and Analysis</h2>
        <p>This move positions GameStop alongside other forward-thinking corporations that are diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin. Following MicroStrategy's lead, this decision signals growing confidence in cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset among traditional businesses.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As more corporations adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, we might be witnessing a broader shift in corporate finance strategies. GameStop's decision could set a precedent for other retail companies looking to modernize their treasury management approaches.</p>
