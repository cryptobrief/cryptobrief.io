Description: Ethereum's Layer 2 networks collectively process more transactions than the mainnet, marking a significant scaling achievement.

Ethereum's Layer 2 scaling solutions have reached a significant milestone, collectively processing over 10 million daily transactions, surpassing the mainnet's throughput for the first time. This achievement marks a crucial turning point in Ethereum's scaling journey.

Leading L2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync have seen exponential growth in user adoption, driven by lower fees and faster transaction speeds. The surge in activity comes as more DeFi protocols and NFT platforms deploy on these scaling solutions.

Market analysts suggest this milestone could accelerate Ethereum's ecosystem growth, as it demonstrates the viability of the "rollup-centric roadmap" championed by Vitalik Buterin. The success of L2s is particularly timely given the increasing demand for blockchain scalability in DeFi and gaming applications.
